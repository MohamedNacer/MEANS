This is  a sample Angular 7 application  created form step by step from scratch and perform CRUD operations.
The backend API is exposed using Node.js, and Express framework.
MongoDB will be used for persistent storage of the data.
I used  Angular CLI 7 to generate the boilerplate project. 
This Angular 7 CRUD Example Tutorial is the comprehensive guide on building CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Web Application using the New Angular 7 Framework. The Angular 7 just released and it comes with a few new feature and improvements.
